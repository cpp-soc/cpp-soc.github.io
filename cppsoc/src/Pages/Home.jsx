        <h3>
          Our mission is to monitor the Student Data Center (SDC) and improve
          its security posture by continuously monitoring logs using System
          Information and Event Monitoring technologies like Splunk, IBM QRadar
          and Microsoft Sentinel.
        </h3>

        <h3>
          Our goal is also to provide students interested in Cybersecurity the
          relevant skills that they will need to give them a head start on their
          Cybersecurity careers.
